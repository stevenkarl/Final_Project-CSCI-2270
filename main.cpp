The menu shown below tells you all of the things that you can accomplish with this program. Also this program utilize a doubley linked list in order to store the answer to the minigame that is playable by selecting choice 5 in the main menu. I hope that you enjoy this program and I hope that you have a good rest of your summer. I would suggest starting by using option # 1 to print out the graph so that you can see wht cities are actually in the Graph. Also Remember to capitalize the first letter of the cities that you type in. " << endl;
