CSCI 2270 Final Project - Steven Karl

Final Project Summary: 
  For my final project I will be creating weighted graph of cities near where I lived in Japan while I studied abroad. I will have the distances between the cities so that you will be able to find the shortest and longest path between certain cities. You will also be able to add and delete cities from the graph. In addition it will also have prices for the distances between the cities so you can calculate the most costly and least costly route. For the prices I will use the cost of a train ride from one city to the next because that is mainly how I traveled while I was there. At the moment below are some of the functions that I think that I will need. I will have a header file as well as a main cpp file that will run the program. The program will be taking in user input for all the options in order to test out the graph and all its functions. For this project I will be using vectors as well as a graph class which stores all of the functionalities that the user can manipulate the graph with.
  Functions that will be included: 
    1) countShortestPath 
    2) countLongestPath
    3) addCity
    4) deleteCity
    5) deleteAll
    6) breadthFirstSearch
    7) DepthFirstSearch
    8) Dystirkira - algorithm 
    9) printGraph 
    10) Various riddle/question functions (about each city for fun)  
    11) insertVertex 
    12) insertEdge
